In order to run the project, you need **clientId** and **clientSecret**. These are your credentials that Zwapgrid uses to authenticate users in Zwapstore. To get your **clientId** and **clientSecret** login to your account in Zwapgrid and navigate to Administration -> Integration -> Clients tab. Create new client, copy **clientId** and **clientSecret** and put these values into appsettings.json.
